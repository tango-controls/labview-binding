//! \class Barrier
//! \brief The YAT "Boost type" Barrier class.
//!
//! An object of class barrier is a synchronization primitive used to cause a 
//! set of threads to wait until they each perform a certain function or each 
//! reach a particular point in their execution.
//!
//! When a Barrier is created, it is initialized with a thread count N. The 
//! first N-1 calls to \link wait wait \endlink will all cause their threads 
//! to be blocked. The Nth call to \link wait wait \endlink will allow all 
//! of the waiting threads to be woken up. The Nth call will also "reset" 
//! the barrier such that, if an additional N+1th call is made to \link wait 
//! wait \endlink, it will be as though this were the first call to \link wait 
//! wait \endlink. \n
//! In other words, the N+1th to 2N-1th calls to \link wait wait
//! \endlink will cause their threads to be blocked, and the 2Nth call to \link 
//! wait wait\endlink will allow all of the waiting threads, including the 2Nth 
//! thread, to be woken up and reset the Barrier. This functionality allows the 
//! same set of N threads to re-use a Barrier object to synchronize their 
//! activity at multiple points during their execution.
//!
//! \remarks
//! While its destructor is virtual, this class is not supposed to be derived.\n
//! Be sure to clearly understand the internal behaviour before trying to do so.
